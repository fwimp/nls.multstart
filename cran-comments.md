## Resubmission

This is a minor resubmission. In this version we have:

- updated the argument supp_errors so that warning messages are suppressed as well as error messages
- changed http --> https in README

## Test environments

- local OS X install, R 4.0.2
- ubuntu 16.04.6 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.2
- win-builder (using devtools::check_win_devel())

## R CMD check results

- There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs
