## nls.multstart

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/padpadpadpad/nls.multstart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/padpadpadpad/nls.multstart)

### Overview

__nls.multstart__ is an R package that allows more robust and reproducible non-linear regression compared to __nls__ or __nlsLM__. These functions allow only a single starting value, meaning that it can be hard to get the best estimated model. This is especially true if the same model is fitted over the levels of a factor, which may have the same shape of curve, but be much different in terms of parameter estimates.

__nls_multstart()__ is the main (currently only) function of __nls.multstart__. Similar to the R package __nls2__, it allows multiple starting values for each parameter and then iterates through multiple starting values, attempting a  fit with each set of start parameters. The best model is then picked on AIC score. This results in a more reproducible and reliable method of fitting non-linear least squares regression in R.

This package is designed to work with the __tidyverse__, harnessing the functions within __broom__, __tidyr__, __dplyr__ and __purrr__ to extract estimates and plot things easily with __ggplot2__. A slightly less tidy-friendly implementation is [__nlsLoop__](https://github.com/padpadpadpad/nlsLoop).
